# Loom

A rough start for what could be a nicely polished Sublime Text bundle for [Loom](http://theengine.co/loom). I wanted to start from scratch instead of just duping some ActionScript syntax file. I'd also like to see a robust collection of snippets and build system commands.

## Install

Until Package Control is setup:

    cd "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/" # Or your platform's equivalent
    git clone https://github.com/ambethia/Sublime-Loom.git Loom

## Pull Requests Welcome!

There's lots to be done. Changes to the `tmLanguage` file are made through the JSON file via [AAAPackageDec](https://bitbucket.org/guillermooo/aaapackagedev)
